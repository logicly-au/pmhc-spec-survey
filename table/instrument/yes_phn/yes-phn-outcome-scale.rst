**The scoring of the YES-PHN is currently under review. Until the review is complete,
the only value that will be accepted is 99 = Not stated / Missing. Once the review is complete
all subscales for all recorded YES-PHNs will be calculated using the approved scoring method.**

The YES PHN Outcome Scale is based on the sum of Questions 13 through 15. Therefore scores fall in the range 3-15.

If any question is missing or invalid (that is, has not been coded 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), it should be set to '99 - Not stated / Missing'.
Where a YES PHN Survey has 6 or more of the first 13 questions missing, the YES PHN Outcome Scale is set as missing.

For the YES PHN Outcome Scale, the missing value used should be 99.
