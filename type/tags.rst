A comma separated list of tags.

Organisations can use this field to tag records in order to partition them as
per local requirements.

Tags can contain lower case letters (or will get lowercased), numbers, dashes,
spaces, and ``!``. Leading and trailing spaces will be stripped. e.g. ``priority!,
nurse required, pending-outcome-1`` would all be legitimate.

Tags beginning with an exclamation mark (!) are reserved for future use by the
Department. e.g. ``!reserved, ! reserved, !department-use-only``.
