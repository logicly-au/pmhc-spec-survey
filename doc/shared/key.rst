PMHC MDS keys are case sensitive and must have between 2-50 valid unicode characters.
Keys must start with A-Za-z0-9 (POSIX :alnum:).

Where data is being exported from client systems, these keys can be auto generated,
providing that a key does not change once it is assigned.

Keys must be generated by the organisation to be unique at the Provider
Organisation level and must persist across time. Creation of keys in
this way allows records to be merged (where duplicate keys of the same record type have been
identified) without having to re-allocate keys since they can
never clash.

A recommended approach for the creation of keys is to compute `random
UUIDs <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier>`_.
