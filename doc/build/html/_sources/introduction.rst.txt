Introduction
============

To support quality improvement and accountability, the Fourth National Mental Health Plan 
(Department of Health and Ageing, 2009) identified the need to develop nationally consistent 
measures of consumer and carer experience of care. This led to the development of the Your 
Experience of Service (YES) Survey, the Your Experience of Service Community Managed 
Organisation (YES CMO) Survey and the Mental Health Carer Experience Survey (CES). These tools 
are being implemented across the mental health sector.  

In 2015, as part of its mental health 
reform agenda, the Australian Government established Primary Health Networks (PHNs) with the 
aim of improving the efficiency, effectiveness and coordination of care. PHNs commission 
services encompassing prevention through to early intervention, treatment and recovery.   

In 2018 AMHOCN was tasked by the Australian Government Department of Health (DoH) with the 
development of a version of the YES Survey suitable for use with PHNs and their mental 
health service providers.  This has become the YES PHN Survey.

This data specification is to be used to upload YES PHN Survey results to and extract YES PHN Survey results from the PMHC MDS.
